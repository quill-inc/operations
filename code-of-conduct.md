## Quill Community Code of Conduct
Quill exists to facilitate sharing content, by making it easy for content
creators to publish and collaborate with others.

Quill is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community.

We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly,
safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.

Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be tolerated.

### tl;dr

- Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
- Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the Quill community.

### Scope
We expect all members of the Quill community to abide by this Code of Conduct at
all times in all Quill community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one
communications pertaining to Quill affairs.

This policy covers the usage of Quill public infrastructure, including the
Quill.is HTTP gateways, as well as other Quill websites, Quill related events,
and any other services offered by or on behalf of the Quill community. It also
applies to behavior in the context of the Quill Open Source project communities,
including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, Slack teams, IRC
channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or
invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of Quill services.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful",
or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the Quill abuse team.

### Friendly Harassment-Free Space
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity,
religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal
characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding
technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a
trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A
difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior
is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames, or other identifiers that might
detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or
written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability,
ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar
personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or
sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-
physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing
photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Media shared through public infrastructure run by the Quill team must not
contain illegal or infringing content. You should only publish content via Quill
public infrastructure if you have the right to do so. This includes complying
with all software license agreements or other intellectual property
restrictions. You will be solely responsible for any violation of laws or
othersâ€™ intellectual property rights.

### Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct
If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of
Conduct, please contact us at abuse@quill.is to send us an abuse report. If this
is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible.
It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

### Copyright Violations
We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. If you
believe any content or other materials available through public Quill
infrastructure violates a copyright held by you and you would like to submit a
notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other similar
international law, you can submit a notice to our agent for service of notice
to: abuse@quill.is

(We will add a physical mailing address here when we acquire one).

Please make sure your notice meets the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
requirements.

### Consequences
All content published to public Quill infrastructure is hosted at the sole
discretion of the Quill team.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the Quill team may take
any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or
permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in
the case of a paid event or service).

### Addressing Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you should notify the Quill team. We will do our best to ensure that
your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in
the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

On IRC, let one of the ops know if you think that someone has transgressed
against the Code of Conduct.

### Contact Info
Please contact abuse@quill.is if you need to report a problem or address a
grievance related to an abuse report.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that
might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are
happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.
